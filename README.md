Hi, I’m  Sahil Gujrati, a computer engineering student from Mumbai, India.
I’m interested in full stack web development, blockchain development, and UI design.
I’m currently trying to enter the web3 space, and create amazing decentralised solutions, supplementing it with my web development and design skills.
I’m always ready for collaboration on interesting ideas, and always ready to learn and be guided.
