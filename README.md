Hi, I’m @Sahil-Gujrati, a computer engineering student from Mumbai, India.
I’m interested in full stack web development, UI design and blockchain development.
I’m currently trying to enter the web3 space, and create amazing decentralised solutions, combining my web development and design skills.
I’m always ready for collaboration on interesting ideas, and always ready to learn and be guided.
Do reach me out, maybe say hi on my email sahilgujrati12@gmail.com !
